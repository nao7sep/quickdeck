// The app version is declared in four manifests, each of which its own tool
// requires to carry a literal value:
//
//   - src-tauri/tauri.conf.json  the version the bundle/installer carries and
//     the OS reports. It is injected into the About dialog as __APP_VERSION__
//     (see vite.config.ts) and is what the release workflow names the installer
//     from. This is the canonical source of truth.
//   - package.json               the npm manifest (private; never published).
//   - package-lock.json          npm's lockfile, which mirrors package.json's
//     version in two places and goes stale if package.json is bumped without a
//     reinstall.
//   - src-tauri/Cargo.toml        the Rust crate version.
//
// Every user-facing surface derives from tauri.conf.json, so the other three
// only have to stay equal to it. This file is the guard that they do, and the
// release workflow runs the test suite (.github/workflows/release.yml: the build
// job needs the test job), so a drift fails the suite and blocks the release
// before any installer is built — rather than shipping one whose filename
// disagrees with the version reported inside the app.
//
// Each version is read inside its own test so a single malformed/missing file
// fails just that case cleanly, instead of throwing during collection and taking
// the unrelated checks down with it. The pure parsing lives in ./helpers/versions
// and is edge-case-tested in ./helpers/versions.test.ts.
