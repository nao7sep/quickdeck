# the Rust release binary, and packages the macOS .app, so type, CSP, and
# packaged-layout errors that run-dev hides surface here; the .app carries the
# correct CFBundleName, so the dock and menu show "QuickDeck" rather than the
# lowercase crate name. run-built is the fast, no-build launcher after this.
